update the packge with PRs  pip install git+https://github.com/microsoft/graphrag.git@main
as part of admin panel
set the api key base etc
set the indexing method as an argument
enable azure AI search and blob storage or cosmos
Fix the fast indexing it appears it only triggers the standard
fix the git remove cache and take care of the settings.yaml
you need to add this ti vite.config.ts 
export default defineConfig({
  // ...other config
  server: {
    host: '0.0.0.0',
    port: 5173,
  },
});

also run yarn dev --host 0.0.0.0


notes:
you need to prompt tuning for global search etc,  if you get an issue with max_length you need to replace that in the prompt
when upgraing you need to do graphrag init --root yourfolder with force flag

set these otherwise youet errors:
    max_retries: 10                   # set to -1 for dynamic retry logic (most optimal setting based on server response)
    tokens_per_minute: auto              # set to 0 to disable rate limiting
    requests_per_minute: auto  


    tesrt the incremental with update


    Auto Tuning:
    graphrag prompt-tune --root ./notebooks --config ./notebooks/settings.yaml --domain "tehcnology" --output ./notebooks/prompt-tuned
    then chage the folders in the settings yaml to point to these prompts
